I've created all the necessary files for both the frontend and backend. Now, here are the steps you need to take to get this running:

### **Your Action Plan**

#### **1. Get Your API Keys**

You need to get API keys from each provider. Go to their respective websites and sign up for a free account/tier:

*   **Google AI Studio (Gemini):**
    *   Visit `aistudio.google.com`.
    *   Create a project and generate an API key. You'll often get generous free limits for experimentation.
*   **OpenAI (ChatGPT):**
    *   Visit `platform.openai.com`.
    *   Sign up and create an API key. You'll get some initial free credits, but be mindful of usage.
*   **Hugging Face:**
    *   Visit `huggingface.co`.
    *   Go to your account settings and generate an API token.

#### **2. Configure the Backend**

1.  Navigate to the backend directory: `cd C:\Users\SERVICING GURU\Desktop\krishiai\backend`
2.  Create the `.env` file (as I explained earlier).
3.  Open the `.env` file and paste your API keys into it:

    ```env
    GEMINI_API_KEY=YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY
    OPENAI_API_KEY=YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY
    HF_API_KEY=YOUR_HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY
    ```
4.  Install the necessary Node.js packages: `npm install`
5.  Start the backend server: `npm start`

You should see the message: `Backend server listening on port 3001`.

#### **3. Run the Frontend**

1.  Open a **new terminal** window.
2.  Navigate to the frontend directory: `cd C:\Users\SERVICING GURU\Desktop\krishiai\frontend`
3.  Install the necessary React packages: `npm install`
4.  Start the development server: `npm start`

Your browser should automatically open to `http://localhost:3000`, and you'll see the "Hybrid Multi-Model AI Chat" interface.

#### **4. Use the Application**

*   Select a model from the dropdown.
*   Type a prompt and optionally attach an image (this will only work with the Gemini model selected).
*   Click "Send" and you should receive a response from the chosen AI service!

### **Next Steps (Deployment)**

To make this publicly accessible, you would deploy the backend to a serverless platform (like Vercel or Netlify) and the frontend to a static site host (also Vercel/Netlify). You would then update the `BACKEND_URL` in the frontend's `App.js` to point to your deployed backend's URL. This setup handles everything we discussed and provides a solid foundation for your hybrid multi-modal AI app.
