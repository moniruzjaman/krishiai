1,Integrated Rice-Duck Farming System | Bangladesh Rice Knowledge Bank,"Integrated Rice-Duck Farming System Bangladesh produces about 26 million tonnes of rice annually and the country has almost attained self-sufficiency in food. However, this increased rice production depends heavily on higher use of chemical fertilizers, pesticides and herbicides, which has increased both the risk of environmental pollution and the costs of rice production. ice research in Bangladesh has so far centred on its cultivation as a sole crop. However, in China , Korea and Japan the ric",,,https://knowledgebank-brri.org/integrated-rice-duck-farming-system/
2,Leaf Color Chart (LCC) for Fertilizer N Management in Rice | Bangladesh Rice Knowledge Bank,"Leaf Color Chart (LCC) for Fertilizer N Management in Rice The LCC is usually a plastic, ruler-shaped strip containing four or more panels that range in color from yellowish green to dark green. Several types of LCCs with varying shades of color have been developed and distributed to rice farmers. This created uncertainties regarding which LCC to use and led to requests for a standardized LCC that serves as a reference in cross calibrating threshold values among LCCs. In October 2003, the Extern",,,https://knowledgebank-brri.org/leaf-color-chart-lcc-for-fertilizer-n-management-in-rice/
3,Drum Seeder Technology for direct wet seeding | Bangladesh Rice Knowledge Bank,"Drum Seeder Technology for direct wet seeding Direct wet-seeding is an alternate method of growing rice instead of conventional transplanting. In this method, sprouted seeds are sown on well prepared puddled land. Direct seeding can be done either by hand broadcasting or by using Drum Seeder. Drum Seeder Technology increase scarcity of labour, save costs and increase yield 10-15% higher than transplanted rice. What is Drum Seeder and Why?

4,Alternat Wetting and Drying (AWD) method | Bangladesh Rice Knowledge Bank,"Alternat Wetting and Drying (AWD) method Boro rice in Bangladesh is fully irrigated and the aman rice is partly irrigated. An estimated 3,000 to 5,000 litres of water is required to produce one kilogram of rice. Recent research at IRRI has proven that using Alternate Wetting and Drying (AWD), about 15-30%, if not more, could be saved without reduction in yield. Starting from about 15 days after transplanting, irrigate until the water table goes 20 cm below the ground level. Dig a 20 cm deep hole",,,https://knowledgebank-brri.org/alternat-wetting-and-drying-awd-method/
